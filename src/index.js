// have an add button to add the tasks - this should not move 
// filtering logic 
// switch pages  




// now we need to filter based on the page and so we grab the tasks and we add them 
// this is where the dom comes in 

//now i need some way to filter the projects with the tasks and we are all good
// I will have some stationary tasks such as: home: today: completed
