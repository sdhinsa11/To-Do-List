//use factory for dynamically creating the to do list

// need a class module for the actual to do list 
// need a page for the default where they see all the to-do lists 
// need a file for the different tasks 
// notes tab 

// the above will keep the tabs constant but what is displayed will change so we need different files for that
// THIS IS combining the restaurant project, the library and the organization of tic tac toe


function Task(title, description, date, section){


}


// 3 sections
// work, health, personal 
// create a to do when click the plus button (like in library)
// have a list of the object created, and list for the other three, put them in there pages and yeah, write the code for the other pages in there but clal it in here 
//first get the default page done nicely then you'll be able to add things for the other pages
// each to do should have title, desc, notes, date and what section its in and a delete button
// show it as the title first and date then when you click on it it should expand
